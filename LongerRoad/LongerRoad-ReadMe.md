		Section I. About
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Longer Road mod allows you to restore your main adversary from the SoA portion of the game back to life, and take him into the party to fight on your side. There are strings attached though... so be careful how you conduct your negotiations with Irenicus, and what exactly do you promise him. Each version of the contract has its negative sides.

The mod was written by a group of authors, most of whom are/were the regulars at the FWS forum or at the Attic fanfiction Forum. I, (Dorotea), can take credit for coordinating their efforts as well as for streamlining the plot and writing most of the Irenicus's banters with PC. No more, no less. Please check the list of banters and authors that is in the Tributes section for more detail.

The mod was coded by three major contributors: Merja (aka Maria Zamphir), Dorotea (aka Janetta Bogatchenko) and Nebukad (aka Tuomas Nurmi). Each one of the coders contributed their unique abilities and tremendous amount of personal time, and without each one of the three the LR mod would have not been possible.

The LR mod has 4 possible outcomes for both Irenicus and the PC.

See the The Longer Road Section for more details on the plot and some spoilers.


		Section II. Installation
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII with the Throne of Bhaal expansion is required. Ascension is not required,
but I definitely suggest having it installed. It adds 'flavor' to LR.
LR should install correctly over any other WeiDU mods. In particular, it
will work fine with other common WeiDU mods (e.g., Tactics, Ascension, Ease-of-Use, Rogue Rebalancing, and various custom npc Romances.)

Extract the main archive into your BGII main directory. This is normally:

        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-LongerRoad.exe". 

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "Setup-LongerRoad.exe". 

You absolutely NEED to start a new ToB game to play LR.
The LR mod works best if you start with either a saved game from SoA finale with 'unlooted' 3rd and above floors of Watcher's Keep, or a new ToB game.

You will NOT be able to obtain the 'good' ending if you have looted the demon maze layer in WK. All other 3 outcomes are still possible.

All Ascension limitations about game freeze are still valid with Ascension - LR combo. 
  

		Section III. The Longer Road 
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I do not wish to be overly verbose here, or to give away more of the plot than 
you have already guessed out.

The mod adds a few additional scenes to the ToB portion of the game that
should start right after your character first appears in the Elder Grove.

1) In order to proceed with the plot you have to have Irenicus's old mask in
your inventory when you are teleported into the Pocket Plane. It is up to the player to obtain it... just be persuasive enough.

If you have the mask you will have a visitor to the PP, soon after you complete 
the first challenge.

2) In order to proceed further you will have to make choices and convince Irenicus to join the party. No, he will not leap at the opportunity or try to blackmail you like Sarevok. So, if you want him you will have to work on it.

3) After you get Irenicus into the party he will have many conversations with PC. It is up to the player how to role-play these. Obviously your choices will affect the final outcome. 

4) Each Bioware npc has multiple banters with Irenicus. There are no banters for custom npcs. Nor there are any future plans to add them, since my policy remains the same - the author of the new npc 'owns' the character. I would not dare to impose my ideas on their vision of their 'baby'.


The highlights of the LR, itself, besides the banters and interjections are:

* Volo conversation, new forced talks with Cespenar, Nyalee, Machine of L.t.M., and many Saradush dwellers if you send Irenicus to talk to them. Basically, try talking to every npc you can think of, to see if Irenicus has anything to say.

* Extensive New Quest in the WK. It starts in the demon maze layer as soon as you enter. You have to have Irenicus in the party when you first enter the maze to start the quest.

* A few neat custom items... not much, but some.

* Experience Cap reset to 40. No need to remove your old one though.

* Many of the original in-game npcs have gained portraits.

* Books of the Elven Lore. Learn more about elves of Toril - the books have new unique bams and there are 7 of them altogether. All info in the books was taken from reliable FR/Ad&D sources. 

* 4 different epilogues for Irenicus. Try to get them all - hopefully they are different enough to be worth the effort.


		Section IV. Speed Banters 
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This component is my own modification of jcompton�s 'Bantergoose' add-on. It makes npcs banters happen more often and in a timed manner. The changes that I made are based on using some different in-game triggers and actions. Install at your own discretion - you might run out of npc banters before the game ends. 


		Section V. Restore Irenicus's original portrait
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This component restores Irenicus's original portrait from SoA section of the game. The LR default is 'Jon with a flame' from Bio's poster. 


		Section VI. Bugs
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please inform Dorotea about any bugs you find in this mod. If they turn out to be true LR-Redemption bugs, we shall fix them. The contact email is once again ladydorotea@hotmail.com.

Separately I want to mention Helseth who was one of our best commentators and testers and who had to limit his involvement in the later stages of the mod development due to RL situation.

Bjorn, and Laufey, whose commentary and suggestion were always extremely helpful and timely.

Also: Caleth, LordE, Seifer and Arcalian


Bams, spells, items, and misc. advice (please remind me if I have missed somebody!)

I also would like to thank all the beta testers, and especially Maidros, Glamdring, Helseth and Darkzas.

Sounds
~~~~~~~
Elysium Nymphs have the voices of Dorotea, Laufey and Jeanette (Caleth).

Irenicus's personal theme is 'March to the Scaffold' by Hector Berlioz (from the Damnation of Faust), Chessmania theme is 'Troll's March' by Edvard Grieg, Ellesime and Seldarine theme is an Elven/Galadriel theme from LoTR, Abyssal music is Shelob's theme from LoTR, Elysium theme is one of the many reiki themes from http://www.reikithehealingpath.com/reiki_music.htm

		Section VIII. FAQ (Spoilers)
	        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: How can I convince Ellesime to give me the mask? 

A: You need a character with Int + Wis >= 24 , and lower stat at least 10.

Q: I am being so polite to her, and she still walks away!

A: Try to be less polite, but not overly rude.

Q: I did everything right and Irenicus still demands a Bhaalspawn soul!

A: He will always demand one, it is up to you to let him have one or not. 
Hint:'I cannot be controlled' is a motto he takes rather seriously...

Q: Do I 'have to' solve the Deva Quest?

A: Only if you want to obtain the 'good' ending.
